Description

For the analysis dashboard

Learning Journey Segmentation

Stick with BMG assigned book readership for ASSIGNED READING

Remove citation filtering for RESEARCH and instead use readership of books not assigned on BMG.

Filters:

Persona (student, independent learner etc.)

Market

Academic discipline (as is)

User type (as is)

Device (desktop / mobile / tablet)

Platform (Web / App)

Suggested filters for frequency analysis:

Persona: Student

Market: USA

Academic discipline: Social Sciences

User type: Consider both

Device: Consider all

Platform: Consider both

Filter everything by September / October cohort

Ô∏è Frequency

Include reading sessions by subscription day/week across

those only reading 1 book

those reading 2 books

those reading 3+ books

Remove cumulative timeline graphs

Keep ARD measures but add ARS (Active Reading Sessions)

Provide ARS median for each book bracket (1, 2 or 3+)

Change the Daily Active Readers by Reading Session graph to be based on subscription day rather than calendar date

# Info
- The goal is to create a subscriber retention strategy based around the different types of learning (research, assigned reading & general knowledge). The learning tribe needs to understand the natural frequency for each of the learning types, which would allow them build an intuition of what is 'expected' and 'good'.
- The dashboard comprises of 2 learning types, **Assigned Reading üë©‚Äçüè´ **   &  **Research üìï** which captures:
  - **Active Reading Days (ARD)**:  
1. Distribution of users Active Reading Days (ARD) within the usage period & the ARD median.
2. The trend on daily active readers by segment (Below & Above ARD) median .
3. The active readers by their subscription week period for both Sept and Oct cohort.
   - **Active Reading Session (ARS)**:
4. Distribution of users overall Active Reading Session (ARS) broken-down into the number of books read (book category: 1,2,3+)  within the usage period & their corresponding  ARS median.
5. The Total Reading Session & Session Per User  by users subscription week period broken-down the number of books read (book category: 1,2,3+).
